# Task Engine - A simple block-by-block code execution framework

Task engine takes all the complicated or redundant aspects of programming and compiles tem into a bite-sized pieces. Task engine provides a simple way of coding stuff like website parsers, Filetype to Filetype converters, automated task execution, etc.

Task engine is based on the python language - an easy to understand scripting language. But to work with this framework, you dont need any python programming skills, as all the functions have been converted into instruction blocks called "gears". These gears get placed syde-by-side and then compiled into a "gearset". Gearsets are collections of gears that then get executed one-by-one, feeding the previous gears' input into the next one.

To start creating your first task, you just need to set the right gears, provide all the necessary inputs and run the gearset. Sounds complicated? No worries, as there are example codes and tutorials provided (TODO: Add links to tutorials and examples).

## Why Task Engine?
Task engine does not require any prior programming, software developement or engineering knowledge - you just gotta know what you want, write it in a config file and push it trough the engine! Pretty much all you need are writing skills and logic. Now, if you are a developer with prior knowledge and think that this would mean creating a very locked environment, then you would be wrong. Task Engine provides support for custom code injection (TODO: Citations needed). Not only that, but you can also create your own gears. Check out the documentation here (TODO: Add links to docs)

I myself created this engine to not rewrite already written code for all my mini-projects like website scrapers. Before, I needed to write each script for specific website and then tweak the code for it's specific needs. But now I can just change 1-2 things in config files and the engine can parse these sites without any problem.

For now I, CracX, work alone, but I do love contributors!
